          "name": "Historical development of cell theory",
          "text": "The historical development of cell theory includes contributions from scientists such as Robert Hooke, who first coined the term 'cell', and Anton van Leeuwenhoek, who observed living cells. The theory was further developed by Matthias Schleiden, Theodor Schwann, and Rudolf Virchow, who proposed that all living organisms are composed of cells and that cells are the basic unit of life."

          "name": "The three main tenets of cell theory",
          "text": "The three main tenets of cell theory are: 1) All living organisms are composed of one or more cells. 2) The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms. 3) Cells arise from pre-existing cells through cell division."

          "name": "Comparison of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells",
          "text": "Prokaryotic cells are simpler, smaller, and lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. They include bacteria and archaea. Eukaryotic cells are more complex, larger, and have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. They include plant, animal, fungal, and protist cells."

          "name": "Cell structure and function",
          "text": "Cell structure includes various organelles such as the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and ribosomes. Each organelle has a specific function, such as energy production, protein synthesis, and waste processing, contributing to the overall function of the cell."
        },
        {
          "name": "The role of cells in multicellular organisms",
          "text": "In multicellular organisms, cells are specialized to perform specific functions. Groups of specialized cells form tissues, which in turn form organs and organ systems. This organization allows multicellular organisms to perform complex functions and maintain homeostasis."
        },
        {
          "name": "Cell metabolism and energy production",
          "text": "Cell metabolism includes all chemical reactions that occur within a cell to maintain life. Energy production in cells primarily occurs through cellular respiration in the mitochondria, where glucose is converted into ATP, the cell's main energy currency. Photosynthesis in plant cells also produces energy by converting light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose."
        },
        {
          "name": "Cell division: mitosis and meiosis",
          "text": "Cell division includes mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is the process by which a cell divides to produce two genetically identical daughter cells, used for growth and repair. Meiosis is the process by which germ cells divide to produce four genetically diverse haploid cells, used for sexual reproduction."
        },
        {
          "name": "The relationship between cells and the definition of life",
          "text": "Cells are considered the basic unit of life because they exhibit all characteristics of living organisms, such as growth, reproduction, response to stimuli, and metabolism. The study of cells helps define what it means to be alive and understand the fundamental processes of life."

          "name": "Applications of cell theory in modern biology",
          "text": "Cell theory has numerous applications in modern biology, including understanding disease mechanisms, developing medical treatments, and advancing biotechnology. Techniques such as cell culture, genetic engineering, and stem cell research are based on principles of cell theory."

        {
          "name": "Implications of cell theory in medicine and biotechnology",
          "text": "Cell theory has significant implications in medicine and biotechnology. It underpins the development of therapies for diseases such as cancer, regenerative medicine using stem cells, and the production of biopharmaceuticals. Understanding cell function and behavior is crucial for advancing medical and biotechnological innovations."
